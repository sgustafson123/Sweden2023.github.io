This repository contains code for a simple itinerary webpage.  It shows the basic travel info, and has links to booking pages.

##How to Use

Copy/paste the link into your browser.  Light blue text indicates links to booking info.

##Code

Most of the code I wrote myself.  I did use Bootstrap card code and free images from the web; but everything else is original.


##Future Changes

This definitely needs code clean-up/refactoring; but I ran out of time to do that.  Should you choose to use this, it is good as a starter template.
